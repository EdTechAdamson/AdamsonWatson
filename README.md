          <li class="list">Edit the head</li>
          <li class="list">Edit the body</li>
          <li>Link to JavaScript</li>

    ```
    - Navigate to the icons on the left, click the boxes icon, type in ``` open in broswer```. This is an extension that will allow you to view your code in the broswer. Install the one by TechER.
    - Navigate back to the ```index.html``` file. Hover over the file, right click and select ```Open in Default Browser``` or use the keyboard shortcut Alt+B.

## Lets add some styling to our web app
1. Open the ```main.css``` file and type...
  ```
  body {
  font-family: helvetica;
}

ul {
  font-family: monospace;
}

li {
  list-style: circle;
}

.list {
  list-style: square;
}

#date {
  font-size: 12px;
  font-style: italic;
  font-weight: bold;
}
  ```
1. Save all work, right click on ```index.html``` and select ```Open In Default Browser``` 

## Lets add some JavaScript
### Implementing strict mode
1. Strict reduces silent errors, improves performance, provides more warnings, and fewer unsafe features when beginning with JavaScript.
1. Type ```'use strict'```

1. Add todays date 
    - First, you'll retrieve a new date from the built-in JavaScript object. It looks like this new Date(). 
    - Next, you can transform the date format by using toDateString().
    - The HTML needs to know where you want to add this information on the page or document, so retrieve an element using getElementById('date').
    - The final step is to insert the date string inside the selected element with innerHTML.
    ```
    let today = new Date();
    let formatDate = today.toDateString();
    let selectElement = document.getElementById('date');
    selectElement.innerHTML = formatDate;
    ```

    - Here we're using the word let to create a variable named today, which holds the date and time. It's a convention to use camel case for variable names with more than one word—for example, the variable formatDate.

    - When you declare a variable, it holds a reference to the value you assign. Variables are a useful way of storing information temporarily so you can reuse the values. In the selectElement variable, you're saving the result of reformatting the date. In that step, you remove the time and timezone from using toDateString().
    
    - Save all work, right click on ```index.html``` and select ```Open In Default Browser``` 
    
## Lets Track our changes with Git
### Open Terminal on VSCode
1. Type ``` git add . ```
    
1. Type ``` git commit -m "Initial commit"```
    
1. Type ``` git push```

bluemix-hello-node

A "Hello World" server in node.js sample for Bluemix.

This repo contains a complete sample of a node.js program that you can deploy
on IBM's [Bluemix](https://bluemix.net/) PaaS, which is based on
the [Cloud Foundry open source project](http://cloudfoundry.org/).

Before jumping into the code, make sure you have an IBM ID, by
registering at the
[IBM ID registration](https://www.ibm.com/account/profile/us?page=reg)
page.  You will need the IBM ID to login to Bluemix from the command line.

You will also need to install the `cf` command-line tool, available
here:

* <https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/releases>

At the time of this writing, the most recent version is `cf v6.1.1`.



install the code for the sample program
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Click the magical button below to deploy the app.

[![Deploy to Bluemix](https://bluemix.net/deploy/button.png)](https://stormy-crag-98204.herokuapp.com/)

or....

From a command/shell terminal
* `cd` into the parent directory you want to install the project in
* `git clone` the project into a child directory
* `cd` into that child directory
* run `npm install` to install dependencies

For example:

    $ cd Projects
    $ git clone https://github.com/IBM-Bluemix/bluemix-hello-node

        ... git output here ...

    $ cd bluemix-hello-node

    $ npm install

        ... npm output here ...


run locally
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After installing, run the server using

    npm start

This should print the following to the console.

    bluemix-hello-node: server starting on http://localhost:8080

If instead, you get something like the following, someone is already
using the default port of 8080:

    Server running at http://127.0.0.1:8080/

    events.js:72
        throw er; // Unhandled 'error' event
                  ^
    Error: listen EADDRINUSE
        at errnoException (net.js:901:11)
        at Server._listen2 (net.js:1039:14)
        at listen (net.js:1061:10)
        at Server.listen (net.js:1127:5)
        ...

Once the server is running, test it by visiting the following URL in your
browser:

    http://localhost:8080/

When you visit the above url the content will be Hello World

    Hello World!!!


Next, test it by visiting the following URL in your
browser:

    http://localhost:8080/hello

When you visit the above url the content will be Hello World

    Hello World



logging into Bluemix
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now that you have your IBM ID and the `cf` command-line tool (see above),
you can log into Bluemix and the deploy your app.

First you should tell the `cf` command which environment you want to operate
with, with the `cf api` command:

    cf api https://api.ng.bluemix.net

You should see the following output:

    Setting api endpoint to https://api.ng.bluemix.net...
    OK

    API endpoint: https://api.ng.bluemix.net (API version: 2.0.0)
    Not logged in. Use 'cf login' to log in.
    No org or space targeted, use 'cf target -o ORG -s SPACE'

Note that as long as you only ever interact with the Bluemix environment with the
`cf` command (and not any other CloudFoundry environments), you won't have to
run the `cf api` command again.

To login to Bluemix, use the following command:

    cf login

You will be prompted for your IBM ID userid and password, as in the following
example:

    $ cf login
    API endpoint: https://api.ng.bluemix.net

    Username> [enter your IBM ID here]

    Password> [enter your IBM ID password here]
    Authenticating...
    OK

You will then be prompted to select your 'org' and 'space', just select the defaults,
which should be your IBM ID userid and `dev`, respectively.

When complete, you should see the following:

    API endpoint: https://api.ng.bluemix.net (API version: 2.0.0)
    User:         [your IBM ID]
    Org:          [your IBM ID]
    Space:        dev



deploying to Bluemix
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can deploy an application to Bluemix with the `cf push` command.

Use the following command to have the application deployed to Bluemix:

    cf push

`cf push` will read the default manifest file `manifest.yml` for some
default values of options related to your application.

Note that in the documentation below, the string `${random-word}` is a
place-holder for a random string that Bluemix will create, so that you
will have a unique hostname running within Bluemix.

After running the `cf push` command above, you should see the following output:

    Creating app hello-node in org <my-IBM-id> / space dev as <my-IBM-id>...
    OK

    Using route hello-node-${random-word}.ng.bluemix.net

At this point, your application is running and you can visit it on the urls

    http://hello-node-${random-word}.ng.bluemix.net
    https://hello-node${random-word}.ng.bluemix.net

If you'd like to continue to play with the server by changing the code, use
the following command when you are ready to push the new version to Bluemix:

    cf push

You can stop the server at any time, by using the following command:

    cf stop hello-node

and then start it later, by using the following command:

    cf start hello-node

When you're ready to delete the server, use the following command:

    cf delete hello-node

privacy notice
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This web application includes code to track deployments to [IBM Bluemix](https://www.bluemix.net/) and other Cloud Foundry platforms. The following information is sent to a [Deployment Tracker](https://github.com/cloudant-labs/deployment-tracker) service on each deployment:

* Application Name (`application_name`)
* Space ID (`space_id`)
* Application Version (`application_version`)
* Application URIs (`application_uris`)

This data is collected from the `VCAP_APPLICATION` environment variable in IBM Bluemix and other Cloud Foundry platforms. This data is used by IBM to track metrics around deployments of sample applications to IBM Bluemix to measure the usefulness of our examples, so that we can continuously improve the content we offer to you. Only deployments of sample applications that include code to ping the Deployment Tracker service will be tracked.

### disabling deployment tracking

Deployment tracking can be disabled by removing the `require("cf-deployment-tracker-client").track();` line from the end of the `server.js` file.
